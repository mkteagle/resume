                <p>Antelope Canyon is a popular location for photographers and sightseers, and a source of
                tourism business for the Navajo Nation. Private tour companies have been permitted to offer tours since
                1987. It has been accessible by tour only since 1997, when the Navajo Tribe made it a Navajo Tribal
                Park.</p>

                <p>The road to the Grand Canyon from the south crosses a gently rising plateau that gives no hint at what is
                about to unfold. You wonder if you have made a wrong turn. All at once an immense gorge a mile deep and up
                to 18 miles wide opens up. The scale is so vast that even from the best vantage point only a fraction of the
                canyon’s 277 miles can be seen.</p>

                layout. When you need to express dialogue or repeat a quotation from another source, this is just perfect!.
                Nearly five million people travel here each year; 90 percent first see the canyon from the South Rim with
                its dramatic views into the deep inner gorge of the Colorado River. So many feet have stepped cautiously to
                the edge of major overlooks that in places the rock has been polished smooth. But most of the park’s 1,904
                square miles are maintained as wilderness. You can avoid crowds by hiking the park’s many trails or driving
                to the cool evergreen forests of the North Rim where people are fewer and viewing is more leisurely. The
                Grand Canyon boasts some of the nation’s cleanest air, with visibility on clear days averaging 90 to 110
                miles.</p>

                <p>Life zones communities and tourism
                The Park contains several major ecosystems. Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence
                of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America. The five life zones
                represented are the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian. This is equivalent to
                traveling from Mexico to Canada. Differences in elevation and the resulting variations in climate are the
                major factors that form the various life zones and communities in and around the canyon. Grand Canyon
                National Park contains 129 vegetation communities, and the composition and distribution of plant species is
                influenced by climate, geomorphology and geology.</p>
