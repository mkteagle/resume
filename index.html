                    <p>Welcome to my resume! We are all smiles in here. I really like the use of clean white space on a resume with very minimal
                        coloring, I think you could say that is how I view my life. I like it to be clean, and I don't like surprises.
                        Blue is my favorite color. I like Computers, TV Shows, Movies, Video Games, and
                        Sports. I wish I was more active, and I cherish my family. In my free time, you will usually always
                        find me on a computer playing around with a website or other project. Just ask my wife!!</p>

                    <p>I have been having such an enjoyable time learning how to program and code. I have used quite a
                        bit of javascript in my website as well as a bunch of css and html. I have learned and loved
                        learning this stuff so much. Just imagine the type of web programmer I can be. I love this stuff,
                    and my past experience can only make me a better programmer or ui designer. I know what to look out for,
                    I know how to avoid grammar errors and mistakes; and if something is on the brink of breaking, I can find
                    it's break points.</p>
